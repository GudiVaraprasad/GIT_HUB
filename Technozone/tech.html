    <h2>TECHNOLOGY</h2>
    <p>Technology is basically the way we execute the discoveries of science and blend it with our own needs. Technology is a general term used to refer to the different tools, machines and equipment we use in everyday life. These tools and equipment have been invented by man to make the tasks faster, easier and more comfortable.</p>
    <p>Although there have been countless examples where technology has changed our lives, there are some which are considered as revolutions for mankind. The technology used in the field of robotics in one such fine example. Nowadays robots are being used by people and industries all over the world for various purposes. They are also used in places which are otherwise considered harmful for humans thereby protecting us. One such area is the cleaning and managing of radioactive waste.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another field which is a classic example of the technological advancements man has achieved. Who could have imagined that a machine would be capable of thinking like us? That is what AI has been successful in doing. It is an intelligent machine capable of behaving like us. It can do activities such as problem-solving, planning, learning and even reasoning. Today AI is used in all major areas such as warfare, security, healthcare and communication. On top of this, it is far more efficient than us and has a lower rate of error.</p>

    <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
    <p>Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific syntactical form called a programming language. A programming language provides a way for a programmer to express a task so that it could be understood and executed by a computer. Refer our another blog-post "What is programming language?" to know more about programming languages. Some of the popular Programming languages are Python, C, C++, Java, etc.</p>
    <p>The backbones of today’s technology companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and many others, are giant computer programs written by a collaboration of thousands of skilled programmers. If you have the right business acumen, knowing programming can help you create the next big tech company.</p><p>Coding is basically the computer language used to develop apps, websites and software. Without it, we’d have none of the major technology we’ve come to rely on such as Facebook, our smartphones, the browser we choose to view our favorite blogs or even the blogs themselves. It all runs on code.</p>
    <p>For example, whether it’s for personal or professional use, more and more people are writing blogs and creating websites to share their message or skills with the world. Being able to understand basic code would allow you to make tweaks to the design of your site without having to pay a webmaster to do it for you or to wait for someone from IT to take care of the ticket you submitted ages ago. A knowledge of code can take you even further if you decide to pursue it. Some in-depth study will provide you with the skills to build a website to your own specifications and to fit your desired needs.<p>If you find you have a passion for technology and a talent for navigating the in-depth nature of computer languages, you could go on to become a professional coder and work for a tech company or even start your own business venture or launch a best-selling idea. The job market is opening up for technologically savvy professionals.</p><p>Having a basic knowledge of coding can simply help you to have a better understanding of how the technology you use every day works. It’s an empowering feeling.</p></p>
