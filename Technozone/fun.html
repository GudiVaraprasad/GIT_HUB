    <h2>FUN and ENTERTAINMENT</h2>
    <p>Entertainment technology is the discipline of using manufactured or created components to enhance or make possible any sort of entertainment experience. Because entertainment categories are so broad, and because entertainment models the world in many ways, the types of implemented technology are derived from a variety of sources. Thus, in theatre, for example, entertainment technology practitioners must be able to design and construct scenery, install electrical systems, build clothing, use motors if there is scenery automation,[clarification needed] provide plumbing (if functioning kitchen fixtures are required, or if "singing in the rain"), etc. In this way, the entertainment technology field intersects with most other types of technology.</p>
    <p>Entertainment technology helps us relax and enjoy some free time. The latest technology has been revolutionized daily entertainment. Old ways such as recording on records, tapes, and CDs, have made music across the world. Movies are brought into living rooms through photography, film, and video. With the emerging of computer technology, ways of being entertained have optimized greatly. Many households are now having computers, consoles, or any other kinds of hand-holding computer game. The diversity and complexity of entertainment technology will bring endless joy and convenient to people's spare time. Traditionally, entertainment technology is derived from theatrical stagecraft, and stagecraft is an important subset of the discipline. However, the rise of new types and venues for entertainment, as well as rapidly advancing technological development, has increased the range and scope of its practice.</p>
    <p>In animation and game design, the phrase "Entertainment Technology" refers to a very real world of entertainment experiences made possible by the advent of primarily computer-mediated digital technologies.</p>
    <p>Gaming Technology is a new technology certainly helps build bigger and better games, but if there were no advances in technology for a while, publishers would continue to produce new products. That’s because this is an entertainment business and it’s driven by creativity as well as technology.The face of video games has changed so drastically that we probably wouldn't have even been able to predict where we are today just five years ago.Gaming technology  are on the cusp of unlocking the true potential of the Internet for video games. Odds are in favor that the way we play games will be completely different, again, just two or three years from now.</p>
